# CertificateSubdomains
This script will give us subdomains from crt.sh

1. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Dependencies:
- Install the required Python packages using pip.
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 chardet
```

4. Run the Script:
- You can run the script by specifying domains directly via the command line or by providing an input file.

### Run the script with the -h flag to see the help message:
```
python crtsh.py -h
